I am a PhD candidate in Behavioral Neuroscience at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/), working in the [Kolachalama Lab](https://vkola-lab.github.io/). My research focuses on **integrating multimodal data and artificial intelligence for precision diagnostics in Alzheimer's disease**.

I work at the intersection of clinical neuroscience and machine learning, leveraging diverse data modalities including:

- **Clinical data** -- cognitive assessments, demographics, and longitudinal patient records
- **PET imaging** -- amyloid and tau positron emission tomography
- **MRI** -- structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging
- **Fluid biomarkers** -- cerebrospinal fluid and blood-based biomarkers

My goal is to develop AI-driven frameworks that combine these complementary data sources to improve early detection, differential diagnosis, and prognostication in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
